## Overview
Brief overview of the project and its objectives.

## Methods

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loaded fMRI data from the hippocampus and amygdala for both negative and neutral pictures.
- Calculated correlation between fMRI signals from the hippocampus and amygdala.
- Filtered out participants with specific criteria from the main and replication datasets.
- Conducted power analysis to determine sample size requirements for various effect sizes.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Tested hypothesis regarding differences in activation between the hippocampus and amygdala in response to negative pictures.
- Conducted t-tests to compare mean activation levels in the hippocampus and amygdala.

### Data Aggregation
- Calculated average memory performance for both short delay (SD) and long delay (LD) conditions.
- Aggregated behavioral data for downstream analysis.

## Results

### Validation of fMRI Data
- The correlation between fMRI signals from the hippocampus and amygdala was found to be consistent across both negative and neutral pictures in the main and replication datasets.
- This suggests a strong relationship between the two brain regions, supporting the validity of the data.

### Hypothesis Testing Results
- The t-tests revealed a significant difference in activation levels between the hippocampus and amygdala in response to negative pictures (p < 0.05).

### Data Aggregation Results
- Average memory performance for both SD and LD conditions was calculated and will be used for further analysis.
